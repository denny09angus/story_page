        <p>Abraham Benjamin de Villiers (born 17 February 1984) is a South African former international cricketer, and a current commentator. AB de Villiers was named as the ICC ODI Player of the Year three times during his 15-year international career and was one of the five Wisden cricketers of the decade at the end of 2019.He is regarded as one of the greatest cricketers in the history of the sport and as one of the best batsmen of his era.de Villiers began his international career as a wicket-keeper-batsman, but he has played most often solely as a batsman. He batted at various positions in the batting order, but predominantly in the middle-order. Regarded as one of the most innovative and destructive batsmen in the modern era, de Villiers is known for a range of unorthodox shots, particularly behind the wicket-keeper.He made his international debut in a Test match against England in 2004 and first played a One Day International (ODI) in early 2005. His debut in Twenty20 International cricket came in 2006. He scored over 8,000 runs in both Test and ODI cricket and is one of the very few batsmen to have a batting average of over fifty in both forms of the game.In limited overs cricket, he is an attacking player. He holds the record for the fastest ODI fifty (16 balls), fastest ODI century (31 balls), and fastest ODI 150 (62 balls).</p>

        <p>Abraham Benjamin de Villiers was born on 17 February 1984 in Warmbad (modern day Bela-Bela), South Africa to Abraham B de Villiers and Millie de Villiers. He has two elder brothers Jan de Villiers and Wessels de Villiers.He described his childhood days as "really relaxed lifestyle up there, where everyone knows everyone".He was educated at Afrikaanse HoÃ«r Seunskool in Pretoria along with teammate Faf du Plessis, who was and still remains his good friend. He is a high school graduate. His father was a doctor who had played rugby union in his youth, and he encouraged his son to play sports as a child</p>

        <p>De Villiers is a right-handed batter who accumulated 8765 runs in Tests including 22 centuries and 46 fifties. He holds the record for most Test innings without registering a duck (78),before being dismissed for nought against Bangladesh in November 2008. He also holds the second-highest individual score by a South African batsman, with an unbeaten 278. Until 2012 he was an occasional wicket-keeper for South Africa, although after the retirement of regular Test keeper Mark Boucher and under his own captaincy he has started to regularly keep wicket for the national side in Tests, ODIs and T20Is. He gave up wicket-keeping in 2015 and handed the gloves to debutant Quinton de Kock.

            He holds the records for the fastest 50 (16 balls), 100 (31 balls) and 150 (64 balls) of all time in One Day Internationals by any batsmen, and also holds the fastest hundred by a South African in Tests and the fastest 50 by South African in T20Is. He is a three-time ICC ODI player of the year, winning the award in 2010, 2014 and 2015.
            
            After the 2011 Cricket World Cup he succeeded Graeme Smith as captain of the national ODI side,and became Test captain after the second Test of the home series against England in 2015/16.He stepped down from Test captaincy in December 2016 due to an elbow injury which kept him out of the team for a long period.
            
            AB de Villiers is claimed by many to be a multifaceted, versatile sportsperson, having excelled in various sports such as golf, rugby, tennis, and hockey.But AB himself admitted that he was never good in other sports except cricket like what others claim to be and also insisted that he never considered himself as a child prodigy.He insisted that he was pity decent at rugby and golf but refused to admit that he held national records in swimming.He openly made such statements to public and has also mentioned it in his autobiography titled AB: The Autobiography, in response to the "falsehoods and exaggerations" about his all-round abilities.</p>

        <h3>2007 Cricket Worldcup in West Indies</h3>
        <p>Going into the 2007 Cricket World Cup, de Villiers was in good form in ODIs, having scored four fifties in five matches against India and Pakistan.

            In the early stages of the tournament his form was poor with three failures including a duck against the Netherlands in a match where his team broke various records for batting,although he scored a 92 in the first round against Australia.
            
            He made his maiden ODI hundred, 146 from just 130 balls including 5 sixes and 12 fours, in the Super 8 game against West Indies on 10 April 2007. He had to bat with a runner for the latter stages of his innings due to a combination of cramps, heat exhaustion and dehydration.His innings consisted of a second wicket partnership of 170 with Jacques Kallis and a third wicket partnership of 70 with Herschelle Gibbs. De Villiers' innings helped set up a total of 356/4 from 50 overs.
            
            His batting during the World Cup was inconsistent as he failed to score on four occasions, in itself being a record.</p>

        <h3>2011 Cricket World cup</h3>

        <p>AB de Villiers scored two successive centuries in the 2011 World Cup. He became the first South African to score two centuries in a single World Cup and the fifth batsman after Mark Waugh, Saeed Anwar, Rahul Dravid and Matthew Hayden to score two consecutive centuries in a single World Cup tournament. He also became the 16th batsman to score two or more centuries in one World Cup tournament. His strike rate of 136.73 is the highest among South African batsmen who have scored centuries in World Cup matches. With his third player of the match award in World Cups, de Villiers is joint second with Jacques Kallis on the list of South African players with most match awards in World Cups. Lance Klusener heads the list with five awards.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>2015 Cricket Worldcup</h3>
        <center><img src="https://www.ballebaazi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ab-de-villiers-hd-wallpapers-rcb.jpg" alt="" height="300vh" width="" ></center>
        <p>De Villiers was one of the top performers at the 2015 Cricket World Cup scoring 482 runs at an average of 96.0 and strike rate of 144.0 during the tournament.[47]

            On 27 February 2015, he scored 162 runs off 66 balls in a match against the West Indies in Pool B, leading South Africa to their second-highest total in World Cup history (408), at Sydney Cricket Ground. With this feat, he became the record holder for the fastest 50, 100 and 150 in ODI history.
            
            Under his captaincy, South Africa qualified for the semi-finals of the World Cup but lost to New Zealand in the match. De Villiers finished the tournament as the third-highest run-scorer with 482 runs, behind Martin Guptill and Kumar Sangakkara.
            
            At the end of the tournament, he was ranked number 1 in the ICC batsmen rating in One day International cricket and number 3 in the ICC batsmen rating in Test cricket.He was named in the 'Team of the Tournament' for the 2015 World Cup by the ICC.</p>

        <h2 style="background-color: lightgray;">Retirement</h2>

        <p>On 6 January 2016, the second Test match between England and South Africa ended in a draw. After the end of the match, Hashim Amla resigned from the captaincy and de Villiers was chosen to captain South Africa for the last two matches.

            On 21 February 2016, de Villiers scored the fastest T20I fifty by a South African, in just 21 balls. He completed the innings with 79 runs in 29 balls and led South Africa to a clean sweep in the T20I series.
            
            On 18 January 2017, de Villiers ruled himself out from most of the Test matches and ultimately played in December 2017.However, a day before the Test match, Faf du Plessis picked up a viral infection, putting him in doubt for the match. On the morning of the Test, he was ruled out of the fixture, with AB de Villiers replacing him as captain. He also kept wicket during the match, as South Africa's wicket-keeper Quinton de Kock suffered a hamstring injury while batting on day one.He took eight catches in the match and the Test match finished inside two days, with South Africa winning by an innings and 120 runs.
            
            De Villiers returned for the Indian tour to South Africa in 2018. He stated he had given up wicket-keeping as his back could no longer handle the demand, and Faf du Plessis resumed his role as captain in all forms of the game.
            
            In the second Test match against Australia, he scored his 22nd Test century with a score of 126 not out off 146 balls in the first innings. His performance helped the team win the match by 6 wickets.
            
            On 23 May 2018, de Villiers announced his retirement from all forms of international cricket through a video uploaded to Twitter, in which he explained his decision.One of the statements in his monologue was "I have had my turn, and to be honest, I am tired."A few weeks after his announcement about retiring from international cricket, he clarified and said that he will continue playing T20 leagues for a few more years.During the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup, and following South Africa losing their first three matches in the tournament, details emerged of de Villiers making himself available for selection for the national team squad on the day the squad was to be announced. He was not selected as he had not played any international cricket for his country leading up to the tournament, despite having been prompted to do so by South Africa's coach Ottis Gibson earlier in the year.
            
            In January 2020, it was rumoured that de Villiers was in talks to make a comeback to the South African T20I side for the 2020 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. De Villiers,as well as South African director of cricket Graeme Smith and head coach Mark Boucher,confirmed these rumours.
            
            In November 2020, de Villiers was nominated for the Sir Garfield Sobers Award for ICC Male Cricketer of the Decade, and the award for ODI cricketer of the decade.</p>
